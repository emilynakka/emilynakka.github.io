# Hi there, I'm Emily Nakkawita.

#### I am a quantitative researcher and Psychology PhD candidate at Columbia University. Prior to pursuing my doctoral studies, I spent nearly a decade as a marketing strategist and engagement director. Across the last 15 years, I have led complex, collaborative projects in settings ranging from Ivy League labs to Fortune 500 companies.

I have expertise in all stages of the research process, from generating hypotheses and designing studies to collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data. Additionally, in my corporate career, I gained extensive experience in synthesizing the results of consumer research and campaign performance analyses into clear, actionable insights that can be understood and put to use by a wide range of stakeholders.

The thread that connects the two phases of my career is my deep interest in motivation science. As a marketer, consumer research illuminated my understanding of our target consumers' motives and needs. In my subsequent academic research, I have investigated the fundamental motivational forces that drive people's thinking and behavior, establishing how these motives work together to drive distinct types of goal pursuit activities. In doing so, I have examined how individuals' beliefs about the importance of these activities, their enjoyment of them, and their behavioral choices are influenced by the relative strength of fundamental motives for control and truth, combined with a focus on gains and non-gains (promotion value) versus non-losses and losses (prevention value).
